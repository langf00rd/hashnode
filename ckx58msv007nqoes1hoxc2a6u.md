## Understanding Web3.0🚀

## Introduction

So all of a sudden the whole Internet starts going crazy about Web3.0... 
Four words, 'web3 is the future' 🚀.

Anyways I'm going to explain web3 just as I would to my 2yr old brother who still can't spell his name 😄.

Lately, Web3 has been trending all over Twitter even my grandma keeps talking about it. So what exactly is web3? Why is it here? How is it going to change the Internet? What alien 👽  mind control technology is it? Let's go back in time:


### 💎 Web1.0

Well in case you live in a pineapple under the sea and don't know what the Internet is, Web 1.0 was the initial stage and the birth of 'www' aka the Internet. The Internet at this time was populated with static HTML websites, mainly business sites for broadcasting information, personal websites where nerds write content about their pokemon collections, and so on. For eCommerce sites, the goal was to present products to potential customers with the help of web1.0

> The Internet at this time was termed "read-only web" according to Berners-Lee

### 💎 Web2.0

Okay so at this point if you play your cards right you might end up being one of the big tech companies depending on user data to make money 😄.

Just kidding tho. This is where the Internet is now, but not for long 😉. People had the ability to contribute content and interact with other web users.

Companies such as Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc all took advantage of web2.0 and therefore aided in making this era of the web more **social**. It is populated with content ranging from Wikis, blogging sites, forums, social media sites, user-generated content, etc. The Internet at this time is a gold mine for content creators. And is obviously not decentralized since user data is being kept in the drawers of some big tech companies 🤫

Is web2.0 a not-so-safe place to be? Well, think about this:

- Your actions on social media. Your clicks, likes, what you watch, your search history, etc are saved by some platforms. 

- Your private data can be leaked.

- User data can be sold so that you are shown more personalized ads and content.

- Identity theft.

Hey, I'm not saying the Internet is a bad place to be. You be the judge of that. The Internet is a very interesting place in my opinion. You get to meet new people, binge watch cat videos, and listen to very inappropriate and depressing songs for free 🎶 

Also since web2.0 is focused more on connecting people and discovering fresh trendy content, some individuals have made millions overnight by selling digital assets aka NFTs (en-ef-teeees) 🌈 at unimaginable prices. Let's talk more about that some other time 😝

###  Web3.0🔥

Now guys. Let's talk about the new kid on the block, web3.0 🦄.

Crypto, blockchain... 

The idea for web3.0 was coined in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood. The idea for a **decentralized** version of the internet started to gain interest in 2020 and 2021 from tech companies and cryptocurrency enthusiasts all over the world.

Web3.0 has caused the rapid emergence of NFTs (NoN-Fungible Tokens) which are digital assets that are bought and sold with cryptocurrencies.

This decentralized version of the internet is based on peer-to-peer technologies which are based on public blockchains. Why blockchain?

- Blockchain is highly **secure and trustworthy** 🔐.
- Reduce compliance costs.
- Speed up ⚡️ data transfer processing **without compromising security**.
- Blockchain helps in **verifying and tracing** transactions.
- Data shared on a blockchain is **immutable**.
- Users stay **anonymous**.

> Blockchain technology makes it almost impossible to change data in a blockchain system

Web3.0 focuses on using big data, **machine learning**, and machine-based understanding of data to provide a user-driven semantic web.
'Semantic markup refers to the communication gap between humans and computerized applications'
The main goal is to create a more **intelligent**, **interconnected**, **open**, and **decentralized web** where user data **isn't** controlled by one single person or corporation. In short, web3.0 is:

- Decentralized
- Open
- Not controlled by a single entity
- Intelligent and AI-based
- Make users remain **anonymous and untrackable**

> The vision is to ensure the user can have access to information as much as possible from anywhere in the world

Basically, web3.0 is here to free us from the control big tech companies have on our private data on the internet. It'll be a good idea for you to take advantage of web3, crypto, and blockchain. You can earn some crypto by selling NFTs.

> Extending Tim Berners-Lee’s explanations, web 3.0 is “read-write-execute.”
